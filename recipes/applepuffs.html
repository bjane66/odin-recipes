<p><h3>A Historical Recipe for Apple Puffs from a Family Friend of Jane Austen, made with apples, marmalade and orange blossom water in puff pastry.</h3></p>
<p><h4> Ingredients </h4><ul> 
    <li>8 ounces puff pastry</li>
    <li>1 pound cooking apples</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon lemon rind, finely grated</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon orange blossom water or 1/2 tsp cinnamon (optional)</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon fine-cut orange marmalade, plus more for topping</li>
    <li>Caster sugar for sprinkling</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h4> Directions </h4><ol><li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Grease and flour a baking sheet, or cover with parchment or a silicone baking sheet. </li>
    <li>Peel, core and slice the apples. </li>
    <li>Stew them in 1/2 cup of water until tender. Drain well and reserve the cooking juice. Allow to cool completely.</li>
    <li>Put the cooked apple in a bowl and mix in brown sugar, lemon rind, marmalade and optional orange blossom water or cinnamon. Taste and adjust flavoring as needed.</li>
    <li>On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry to 1/8 inch thick and cut the pastry into 8 4-inch squares.</li>
    <li>Divide the apple puree between them, placing it in a line across the center of each square and stopping well short of the ends.</li>
    <li>With a pastry brush, use the reserved apple cooking liquid to dampen the edges of the pastry.</li>
    <li>Fold the two edges parallel with the line of filling over the puree. Pinch and seal the edges together with a fork, forming a tube.</li>
    <li>Pinch and seal the ends of the tube together and use a fork to seal shut.</li>
    <li>Brush the pastry lightly with the reserved apple cooking liquid and sprinkle with caster sugar.</li>
    <li>Using a sharp knife, gently cut vents into the top of the pastries.</li>
    <li>Place the puffs on the greased or lined baking sheet and bake for 20 - 25 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Serve warm, topped with a little extra marmalade or candied orange peel.</li>
